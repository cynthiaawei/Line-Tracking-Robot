# Summer Hardware & Robotics Workshop â€“ Autonomous Line Tracking Robot Competition

## Overview

This project was developed during a 2-week Summer Hardware and Robotics Workshop at the University of Toronto, designed for first-year students. The workshop focused on hands-on skills in circuit design, circuit debugging, robotics, Arduino programming, and embedded systems.

## What I Learned

- Arduino basics and hardware setup
- Debugging circuits and code
- Writing logic and control algorithms for robots
- Real-time sensor integration

## Project Description

The main challenge was to design and program an autonomous robot to follow a line with maximum efficiency and speed. My solution involved:

- Developing custom logic for precise line tracking using sensor input
- Optimizing the code for fast and stable performance
- Iterative testing and debugging
